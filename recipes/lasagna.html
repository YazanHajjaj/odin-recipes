<img src="../img/lasagna.jpeg" alt="lasagna">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A rich and creamy whole-wheat pasta dish filled layer by layer with refreshingly fresh onions and garlic, lathered in a succulent sauce and topped with imported, premium quality mozzarella.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
    <li> Onion and garlicÂ· Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
    <li> Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
    <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta, so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>

    <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
